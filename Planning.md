## What Software Engineering Principle Do You Want To Learn Through Python?

* [Software Development Skills For Data Scientists]
    
    * Writing modular, reusable code
    * Documenting / Commenting
    * Version Control - Git
    * Testing
    * Logging

## Estimate Time Required To Achieve Goal

I will give myself the whole 2016-Q4 to work on this goal. It seems like a long time, but effectively, I have only 8 weeks left (as of 2016-10-08) because of Open, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 

**Timeframe**: Efficiency parity by end of October. One contribution to Airpy by Mid November. One ongoing big project touching different stacks in Python by the end of 2016.

## Break Down Work Into A Week-by-week Schedule

* **Week of 8/8 - 8/14**: Start watching Stanford CS 41
* **Week of 8/15 - 8/20**: Finished Stanford CS 41 + started Data School Pandas videos
* **Week of 8/21 - 8/28**: Detour to watch Tom Augspurgur's Pydata video
* **Week of 8/29 - 9/4**: Birthday week
* **Week of 9/5 - 9/11**: Start reading Idiomatic Python + Finished Data School Pandas videos series
* **Week of 9/12 - 9/18**: Start reading "Python Data Analysis" by Wes Mckinney
* **Week of 9/19 - 9/25**: Start practicing Python on the job (calculating cohort size from lead ranking)
* **Week of 9/26 - 10/2**: Continue to practice Python on the job (variable transformation model) + Data School Machine Learning videos. This is one of the best examples of learning on the job with Python.
* **Week of 10/3 - 10/9**: Built a simple data visualization of demand index using Python's Bokeh library + Finished Data School ML videos
* **Week of 10/10 - 10/16**: Continue to play with Bokeh, made slider (interactivity) worked, and made animation of world demand viz worked. A bit reading on command line in Python
* **Week of 10/17 - 10/23**: Practice with writing a simple Python parser for excel to get event annotation. Made timeseries and interactivity worked. Started reading Python OOP articles
* **Week of 10/24 - 10/30**: Simeon Franklin's OOP class - first part
* **Week of 10/31 - 11/4**: Simeon Franklin's OOP class - second part (less useful)
* **Week of 11/7 - 11/11**: BIDS video on OOP + Coursera's Introduction to DS in Python Class + Chris Albon's notes + Heroku Deployment of Airbnb-open-data-viz app
* **Week of 11/14 - 11/18**: (Airbnb Open - Half week) Start building First Stage Model for LTV project in Python + [Pandas Plotting Documentation] + BIDS: Scipy Pandas + Scientific Workflow in Python (both are marginally helpful)
* **Week of 11/21 - 11/25**: (Thanksgiving - Half week) On the Job learning for scikit-learn (pipeline, learning curve) + BIDS matplotlib review + Data School: writing pythonic code + Test Driven Development for Scientist blog post
* **Week of 11/28 - 12/2**: BIDS Ipython notebook, BIDS functions/modules, BIDS: advanced string, BIDS testing driven development, Jeff Knupp's Unit Testing, Software Carpentry on Testing with Python
* **Week of 12/5 - 12/9**: BIDS Numpy, BIDS Advanced Interaction, Simeon Franklin's higher order function, Jeff Knupp's "improve your python series": yield/generator, decorator, drastically improve python understanding of execution code, loop like a native (really good)
* **Week of 12/12 - 12/16**: During the weekend (12/9), add more newer topics (logging, command-line tool, and building packages) for 2017. No active learning for this week, but wrap up by reviewing materials for a blog post
